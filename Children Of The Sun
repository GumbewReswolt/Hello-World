Fighting and running from
Turning from who we really are
Cannot suppress
So let's find the one we have shaped so far

Flying too close to the sun
As if we're invincible
Cannot dictate
Dominate the earth that we're living on

We can't defy the laws
Cut the laws that we consummate
Around the world
We grow weaker as we exterminate

The only thing that gives
Thing that brings air and light to us
Wake up one day
And find what we got is so serious

We are the children of the sun
We are the children of the sun

The human greed and our creed
Is all that we have to share
Knee deep in tragical
Fabrical issues everywhere

Cannot replace the one
Chase the one that we used to be
It isn't how we were
Why we're here, what we're meant to be

Fighting and running from
Turning from who we really are
Cannot suppress
So let's find the one we have shaped so far

Flying too close to the sun
NOPE
Cannot dictate
Our fate on this earth we are living on

We are the children of the sun
The love for everyone
Always on the run
The fire in our eyes
The passion never dies
We are the chosen ones
The children of the sun

We are the children of the sun
The love for everyone
Always on the run
The fire in our eyes
The passion never dies
We are the chosen ones
The children of the sun

We are, we are
We are the children of the sun

We are, we are
The children of the sun

We are, we are
We are the children

Always on the run
